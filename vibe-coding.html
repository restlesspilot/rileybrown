        <h1>Vibe Coding</h1>
        
        <p>Riley Brown has pioneered a revolutionary approach to software development called "Vibe Coding" - a method that uses artificial intelligence to build applications through natural language prompts, making programming accessible to everyone.</p>

        <h2>What is Vibe Coding?</h2>
        <p>Vibe Coding is a programming technique that enables developers to create software using only AI assistance and voice commands. Riley defines it as "the act of using only your voice in Cursor Composer to build apps, forgetting the code even exists."</p>

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Traditional Coding Required</strong> - Users describe what they want in natural language</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Development</strong> - AI programs like Claude and Gemini handle the actual code generation</li>
            <li><strong>Voice-First Approach</strong> - Many applications can be built using voice commands alone</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong> - Complex applications can be created in minutes rather than weeks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Comprehensive Vibe Coding Guide</h2>
        <p>Riley has created what he calls "the most comprehensive guide for Vibe Coding with Cursor," featuring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>250 minutes of detailed instruction</li>
            <li>All the Vibe Code basics for Cursor</li>
            <li>4 complete projects demonstrated from start to finish</li>
            <li>Designed for people who have never written a line of code</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>Through Vibe Coding, Riley has demonstrated the creation of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ChatGPT clones with real-time voice interaction</li>
            <li>Mobile applications with complex functionality</li>
            <li>Web platforms and interactive tools</li>
            <li>Games, simulations, and web pages</li>
            <li>Note-taking applications with AI integration</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>The Vibe Coding methodology primarily utilizes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cursor Composer</strong> - The primary development environment</li>
            <li><strong>AI Models</strong> - Claude, Gemini, and other language models</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Recognition</strong> - For hands-free development</li>
            <li><strong>React Native Templates</strong> - For mobile app development</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact and Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Vibe Coding represents Riley's vision of democratizing software development. By removing the traditional barriers of syntax, debugging, and complex programming concepts, he's making it possible for anyone with an idea to bring it to life through technology.</p>

        <p>This approach addresses one of Riley's core beliefs: that people often don't pursue computer science because they don't experience success early enough in their learning journey. Vibe Coding provides immediate, tangible results that can inspire deeper exploration into technology.</p>
