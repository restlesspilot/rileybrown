        <h1>VibeCode</h1>
        
        <p>VibeCode represents Riley Brown's vision of democratizing app development through artificial intelligence. Co-founded with Ansh Nanda and Kehan Zhang in San Francisco, VibeCode is revolutionizing how people create mobile applications.</p>

        <h2>What is VibeCode?</h2>
        <p>VibeCode is an AI-powered platform that enables users to create fully functional mobile apps without writing a single line of code. Think of it as "Canva or CapCut for app building" - users simply describe their app idea in text, and VibeCode transforms that vision into reality.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The process is remarkably simple:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users submit text prompts describing their desired app functionality</li>
            <li>VibeCode's AI processes the description and generates a complete mobile application</li>
            <li>Apps are created in as little as 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Users can further refine their apps through additional simple prompts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impressive Results</h2>
        <p>The platform's beta test showcased remarkable adoption:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>200 initial beta users</li>
            <li>Over 3,000 apps created during the beta period</li>
            <li>Applications ranging from rental services to photo sharing platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Business Model</h2>
        <p>VibeCode operates on a subscription model with a limited number of prompts per day, making advanced app development accessible to creators and entrepreneurs at every level.</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Riley hopes VibeCode will inspire creators to launch apps for their audiences by making the development process more accessible than ever before. The platform removes traditional barriers to app development, enabling anyone with an idea to bring it to life.</p>
