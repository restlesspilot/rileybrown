        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Riley recently moved to San Francisco to launch his startup VibeCode, working alongside co-founders Ansh Nanda and Kehan Zhang. His journey into AI education began with a simple mission: to bridge the gap between complex AI technologies and practical, everyday applications.</p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Riley believes that "one of the reasons why people don't get deep into computer science is they don't get hit with the 'aha' moment soon enough." His approach focuses on creating those breakthrough moments through practical, hands-on learning experiences.</p>

            <li>Developing accessible AI education content for non-technical audiences</li>
            <li>Building VibeCode, a platform that democratizes app development</li>
            <li>Exploring the future of AI-powered video editing and content creation</li>
        </ul>
